# Bolivar

> Get independant from external css, js and images

Bolivar is a CLI for removing external CSS, JS and image dependencies from your projects, moving them into `css`, `js` and `img` folders. It's convenient if you used a lot of CDNs and external images and now want to work offline on your HTML.

Just install it with `npm install -g bolivar` and use `bolivar` in your projects root.

Make sure the project is GIT version controlled in case Bolivar screws something up. Bolivar will skip the `.git` and `node_modules` directories.

## Command Line usage
```
$ bolivar -h
Usage: bolivar [options]

Options:
   -r, --root     The root directory to work on  [/Users/finn/code/node/npm/bolivar]
   -s, --silent   When set no messages will be printed
   -f, --force    Run bolivar without aborting on warnings

```


## Script usage
You can also use bolivar via require. It will not `console.log` messages but emit
`file` and `url` events as well as an `end` event.
```javascript
	var bolivar = require('bolivar');
	bolivar({root: '/folder')
		.on('file', function(file) {
			console.log('Acting on ' + file.name);
		})
		.start();
```
